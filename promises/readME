before callback we use callbacks to handle the asynchronous tasks like 
*A promise is an object that represnets the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation

it has three states 
@pending - intial state ( not yet started)
@resolved(fullfilled) - operation completed successfully
@Rejected - operation failure
